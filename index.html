          there are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex. 
          if the word 'hate' was engraved on each nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles 
          it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate i feel for humans at this micro-instant.</h1>
